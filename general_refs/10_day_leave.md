Subject:  Planned Vacation Leave

Hi Rags,

This is to request you for your approval for a ten-day leave for my planned trip to Kerela with my family. I have been collecting my leaves for the trip, and I am very excited about the same. 

I am writing this letter to formally notify you about my leaves from 10 Jan, 2022 to 20 Jan, 2022. I will join office from Monday, i.e. on 21 Jan, 2022.

I am aware during this period some critical release has to happen.
You can contact XYZ in my absence as he is aware of the same. I can be reached at email id vaibhav.katariya@gmail.com and phone number 8978675678 in case of any queries.

KT's are in progress with XYZ regarding the above release. I Will make sure that before I left for the vacation I'll transfer sufficient knowledge to the team.

I hope you will acknowledge my application and process the same earliest. 

Thank You

Yours Sincerely

Vaibhav katariya

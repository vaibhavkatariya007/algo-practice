Hi My name is vaibhav katariya. i am working as frontend engineer in Goeducate project.

So without taking much time I will directly come to the Point.

As a frontend engineer i always want that my application look 
good and beautiful at the same time i want my app to perform well.
But the problem here is that maintain the performance of the application is little challenging. Because if i am increasing the quality of the graphics the application load time also increases. 
So we have the solution we have to compress as max as we can without quality degradation we fix the problem.

Hurrah my app is perfoming well again.

But how to control the dynamic images. i.e, if one user uploading from one end of the app and displaying on other end.

Here i want to take an example of the ecommece application.
we are having two apps 
1. is admin for to manage the products. ie to upload product images and other stuff
2. is market place where we display the product listing.

we can automate with the process it will compress our assets and we deliver to the market place. But we face the problem like streching, pixlating etc. of the images if we are using the same image in multiple area with different view ports like card and banner.

How we over come with this problem 
We use cloudinary tool which is managing all our assets and give us the
capability to transform the images on the fly without compromising the 
quality. It provides us to waste our energy in optimization it makes
us capable to focus on delevering the features on product and speed 
up our development process.
and Some AI plugins are available.
such as face detection we are using in our application.

My next topic i want to highlight  another problem 
How to monitor the appliction issue and monitor performance?
Our application is running on production as a developer we are maiting the log files to cpture the errors, on daily basis we are reviewing and fixing the issues. But its a time taking process.

There are many tools available which provides the way to mointer the issues
at real time.
